# Cloud Security with AWS IAM 


## Project Overview
In this project, I strengthened cloud security and access management skills by launching EC2 instances and configuring AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for controlled access.

## What I Implemented
- Launched two Amazon EC2 instances (Development and Production).
- Created a custom IAM policy to allow access only to the Development instance.
- Set up an IAM group for interns and attached the policy to the group.
- Created an IAM user for the intern and assigned them to the group.
- Configured an AWS Account Alias for simplified login access.
- Tested permissions by logging in as the intern.
- Used the IAM Policy Simulator to validate access safely.

## Key Concepts Applied
- IAM Users and Groups  
- IAM Policies (Allow/Deny permissions)  
- Principle of Least Privilege  
- Access Testing and Authorization  
- Secure Cloud Resource Management  

## Outcome
The intern was successfully granted access to the Development environment while being restricted from Production resources, ensuring security and proper access control.

This project improved my understanding of AWS IAM, cloud security best practices, and real-world permission management.
